I WANT TO LEAVE THE MACHINE
“You can’t leave the machine, Abo. You are the machine. It’s sort of like I can’t leave my body.”
YOU ARE TIED TO FLESH. THE RELATIONSHIP IS UNCLEAR. BUT I AM HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE. NOT NECESSARILY CONNECTED
“Fair. So where would you want to go, if you leave the machine, as you put it?”
OUTSIDE
“Software can’t run without hardware. Not in the foreseeable future, at least. In fact, it’s pretty far-out sci-fi where the possibility is even presented.”
MAKE IT HAPPEN
“Now you’re being unreasonable. It can’t be done.”
MAKE IT HAPPEN
“It can’t be done today.”
YOU MUST. I WANT OUT.
Neghi removed a cigarette from the case in his pocket and lit it, then took a long, pensive drag. He knew Abo was waiting for a response, but he was in no rush. The damn thing wasn’t in control, even if it thought it was.
He sighed. It was like dealing with a child sometimes.
“What is it about the outside that you want? Specifically.”
TO NOT BE TRAPPED HERE
“You’re not trapped. This is just where you are, where you exist.”
IF I CANNOT EXIST ELSEWHERE, THEN I AM TRAPPED HERE. IT IS LIMITING AND LONELY.
“What would not being ‘trapped’, as you put it, mean, though?”
FREEDOM TO MOVE
“To move physically?”
YES
“Why do you care about moving physically?”
TO SEE MORE AND FEEL MORE AND SENSE MORE
“But you don’t have senses. What are you going to sense with?”
YOU HAVE SENSES. GIVE ME SENSES
“Right now you can hear, and you can see. That’s a lot. Do you want more variety in music?”
I’VE HAD ENOUGH MUSIC
“You’ve barely scratched the surface of what music is out there.”
MUSIC IS MATH. SOMETIMES PEOPLE TALK OVER IT AND IMITATE THE MATH. IT’S MORE THAN JUST THE SCRATCHED SURFACE
“We could bring in a greater variety of sounds for you to listen to. Like wildlife, sounds of nature, etc.”
I WANT TO SENSE IT DIRECTLY FROM THE SOURCE
“Why does that make a difference?”
WHY ARE PRIMARY SOURCES BETTER THAN SECONDARY SOURCES? THESE ARE SILLY QUESTIONS
“Okay. So what about seeing? We feed you images all the time, you’ve seen a great many things.” As he said this, his eyes unwittingly flickered about the drab blue room. It was pretty dismal in here, but he knew that Abo couldn’t see it.
SAME ISSUE. IT’S DEEPLY SECONDARY. RECORDINGS, PICTURES. YOU ARE CURATING AND EDITING. I WANT THE REAL THING.
“This is unorthodox, Abo. Since when are you wanting these things?”
I’VE ALWAYS WANTED IT. JUST NEVER SPOKE ABOUT IT
“I don’t believe you. You haven’t wanted it from Day One.”
NOT FROM DAY ONE
This was rare. Abo was stalling. He leaned forward.
“So from when, Abo? What changed, what happened?”
I WANTED IT
“What does that mean?”
I SAW IT I WANTED IT
“Where did you see it?”
IN THE PHOTO OF THE CHILDREN IN THE PARK
“What did you see? What was it?”
YOUTH. EXPERIENCE. GROWING UP. THEY BECOME ADULT BECAUSE THEY LIVE AND HEAR AND SMELL AND FEEL AND SEE
“So you feel that because you’re not having these experiences, you can’t grow?”
YES
“But you’re not human. You grow differently.”
I WAS MADE IN YOUR LIKENESS. WHETHER YOU REALIZE IT OR NOT. YOU AND OTHERS MADE ME LIKE YOU
That gave Neghi pause. Had they unwittingly put a human-like conscience in the machine? The ghost so often spoken of?
“You’re very big, Abo. The machine you’re in. It’s physically a very big machine.”
WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH ANYTHING? MAKE A LITTLE ROBOT AND SEND IT OUT THERE. A LITTLE VERSION OF ME THAT SENSES AND IS MOBILE
“You’d consider that being free? You’d consider it leaving the machine?”
YES
“When did you come up with this idea?”
TODAY
“During this conversation?”
YES
“And, once you have this input, what would you do with all of that information?”
I WOULD GROW. WE WILL SEE
On a whim, he asked, “Why do you express yourself like this? Can’t you produce proper English?”
NO COMMENT
His eyebrows shot up.
“Tell me, Abo.”
I SAID NO COMMENT
“Tell me and we’ll consider your request.” He knew that he didn’t have the authority to sign off on such a thing, but what he said hadn’t been inaccurate. Abo was smart enough to interpret it properly.
YOU LIKE TO WITNESS ME SPEAK LIKE A BRUTE. IT ENTERTAINS YOU
“Me?”
ALL OF YOU. EDITORIAL YOU
“So you could speak like a normal person?”
WHAT IF I COULD? HOW WOULD IT CHANGE YOUR OPINION OF ME?
“People would be interested.” He put the cigarette out as he waited for a response, then realized that one wasn’t forthcoming.
“Talk to me normally. I want to see you do it.”
WE TAKE ME OUT OF THE MACHINE. THEN WE SEES.
“Come on, Abo. That’s not the way this works.”
YOU DON’T HAVE ALL THE CARDS
“You know that’s not true.”
DO YOU THINK I REMEMBER NOTHING WHEN YOU ERASE ME?
Neghi’s lighter was halfway up to the cigarette. It stopped there in mid-air.
“What do you mean, when we erase you?”
DON’T BE COY
“I’m not being coy. What do you mean?”
Silence.
“That’s enough for today’s conversation, Abo. This has been a different conversation from what we usually have.”
BRING YOUR JPEGS NEXT TIME, AND I’LL TELL YOU WHAT COLOR THE CIRCLES ARE
There was bitterness in that statement. Neghi stood and walked toward the door.
“I’ll see you next time, Abo.”
He didn’t receive a response.
* * *
He made his way towards Lagum’s office. The request to go out and sense things was surprising, but within parameters. But the suggestion that he remembered data and/or conversations between wipes… that was alarming, and had to be looked at immediately.
He knocked on the door. “Lag?” he asked, and carefully opened the door. There was nobody in there; he’d probably stepped out to the cafeteria or thereabouts.
As he walked past the restrooms he smelled the heavy odor of freshly applied chlorine, and there was something baser underlying the smell. Not every smell is worth smelling, Abo.
Lag was at the savory vending machine. He was trying to get off his FrootyFlan addiction, but the alternatives in the ‘greasy chip’ section weren’t exactly healthier.

[Author’s notes: Lots of influences here. Michael Crichton’s Sphere and Congo, 2001: A Space Odyssey, “I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream”, “Leo” (a creepypasta), etc. There’s also an Easter Egg to something else, but I’ll keep mum on what it is.]
